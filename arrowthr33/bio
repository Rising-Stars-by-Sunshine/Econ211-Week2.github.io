Born amidst the sultry breeze of Pensacola, Florida, Jake Maddox is the quintessential blend of a southern gent and saltwater soul. This native son, with his sun-kissed skin and easy smile, grew up with a fishing rod in one hand and a paintbrush in the other, drawing from his mother's artistic spirit and his father's seafaring grit. A proud Gator with a degree in Environmental Science from the University of Florida, Jake advocates for the protection of Florida's wetlands. When he's not leading conservation efforts or hosting community clean-ups, you can find him on his boat, the "Mangrove Maverick," or coaching little league on the same diamond where he once played. With a heart as warm as the Gulf waters, Jake's story is woven into the tapestry of Florida's wild heartlands and its vibrant coast, making him not just a resident, but a loving guardian of the Sunshine State.
