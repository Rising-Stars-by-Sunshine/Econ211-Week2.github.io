Machine learning-based ship detection and tracking using satellite images for maritime surveillance,"The recent advancement in remote sensing technologies has resulted in the availability of different imaging modes and higher resolution satellite images. Accessibility of these remote sensing or satellite images, automatic ship detection and tracking has become an important research topic in the field of maritime surveillance. In this paper, a novel method for ship detection using satellite images is proposed. First the preprocessing is carried out to remove the noise from the images using Ship Detection and Tracking (SDT) filter. Then, the land masking (sea-land area separation) and cloud masking is carried out based on the gradient feature extraction using SDT edge detection, along with SDT segmentation. Finally, the ships are identified using the Machine Learning (ML) classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), KNN, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes-based classifier based on the features extracted from Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The proposed work is cross validated using the Google earth data. Performance of our proposed method is evaluated using the recall and the precision values. Further, for tracking ships, an improved multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm is proposed and tested using the Kaggle dataset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The recent advancement in remote sensing technologies has resulted in the availability of different imaging modes and higher resolution satellite images.
