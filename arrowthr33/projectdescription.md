This project leverages machine learning and explainable AI to analyze satellite imagery and AIS data for tracking global maritime traffic. Utilizing high-resolution images from sources like Copernicus by ESA, and real-time vessel information from AIS, the project aims to monitor and report on maritime activities, contributing to understanding the health of the global maritime trade economy. By integrating these diverse data streams, the system will provide weekly insights into shipping patterns, vessel movements, and trade flows. This innovative approach promises to enhance maritime situational awareness, offering valuable economic and environmental implications through advanced, AI-driven analysis and transparent, interpretable reporting.
