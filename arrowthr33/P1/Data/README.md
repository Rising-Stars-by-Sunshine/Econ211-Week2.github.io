  For this project, crucial data collection entails acquiring high-resolution satellite imagery from reputable sources such as Copernicus by ESA, focusing on regions of maritime commercial activity. This imagery will serve as a primary dataset for identifying and tracking maritime vessels using machine learning models. Additionally, AIS (Automatic Identification System) data, which provides precise vessel locations, identities, and additional attributes, will be collected to validate the findings from the satellite imagery analysis and to serve as ground truth data. This AIS data, when juxtaposed with the satellite imagery, can help in creating a more comprehensive understanding of maritime traffic patterns. Moreover, temporal data collection is vital to facilitate time-series analysis, enabling the monitoring of maritime traffic evolution over time, and the identification of anomalies or trends that might indicate broader economic or geopolitical developments affecting the maritime trade economy. Collectively, these datasets form the backbone of our analysis, allowing for a multifaceted exploration of global maritime trade dynamics.

  The data for the maritime traffic analysis project is an amalgamation of high-resolution satellite imagery and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, offering a comprehensive view of global maritime activities. The satellite imagery data includes unique image identifiers, geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), timestamps, spatial resolution details, and raw pixel data. These images provide a visual representation of maritime regions, capturing vessels and oceanic traffic patterns with precise geographic location and time information. The frequency of satellite data collection can vary, commonly ranging from daily to weekly, depending on the project requirements.
  Complementing this, the AIS data delivers real-time information transmitted by vessels, encompassing unique vessel identifiers, precise positional coordinates, speed, course, timestamps, vessel types, and destinations. This data is updated frequently, often in near real-time, and covers all AIS-equipped vessels globally. Together, this rich dataset not only enables detailed analysis of maritime traffic but also facilitates the monitoring of global trade flows, environmental impacts, and maritime security aspects.
