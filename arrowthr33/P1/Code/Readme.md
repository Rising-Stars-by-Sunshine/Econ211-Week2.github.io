The data query process is central to this project, ensuring that relevant, high-quality data is continuously acquired for analysis. Initially, a structured query protocol will be established to fetch satellite imagery from Copernicus by ESA and AIS data from designated providers, focusing on key maritime routes and ports. These queries will be automated to run at specified intervals, ensuring a steady influx of fresh data. For satellite imagery, the queries will be tailored to retrieve high-resolution images that enable accurate maritime object detection. The AIS data queries will focus on capturing comprehensive vessel information including location, identity, and voyage details. Additionally, to enrich the time-series analysis, historical data will be queried to provide a baseline for identifying trends and anomalies. The query process will be optimized to handle any data inconsistencies or missing values, ensuring the integrity of the data being collected. Moreover, a robust error-handling mechanism will be integrated to address any issues during the data retrieval process, ensuring the continuity and reliability of data acquisition. This systematic query process is designed to fuel the machine-learning and explainable AI components of the project with the requisite data, facilitating insightful analysis and reporting on global maritime trade dynamics.
