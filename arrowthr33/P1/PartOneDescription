Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging area of AI research focusing on how AI systems arrive at solutions and answer various "why" and "how" questions. This capability contrasts with traditional AI, where such explainability is lacking. XAI's importance is underscored in applications where understanding the AI's decision-making process is crucial for trust and transparency, such as in healthcare, defense, and autonomous driving vehicles. A key question that often emerges in XAI literature concerns the balance between model complexity and interpretability, particularly in AI applications involving critical decision-making based on complex data.

**Theoretical Analysis**: Develop frameworks that clarify the decision-making process of AI models used for analyzing satellite imagery and maritime data. Theoretical models can explain how various AI components, like neural networks, contribute to final conclusions, such as vessel identification or traffic patterns.

**Empirical Observation**: Collect and analyze data from real-world scenarios where these AI models are applied. This might include observing how the AI interprets different types of maritime activities and conditions in satellite imagery and comparing these interpretations with human expert analysis to identify discrepancies or areas for improvement.

**Experimental Investigation**: Conduct experiments to test different XAI methods, such as feature visualization or attention mechanisms, within your AI models. This can reveal how changes in the AIâ€™s internal processes affect its output and interpretability, specifically in the context of maritime tracking.

**Background/Motivation:**
In an increasingly globalized world, maritime trade serves as a crucial artery of the global economy, facilitating the exchange of goods on an unprecedented scale. The dynamics of maritime traffic reflect broader economic trends and conditions, rendering the monitoring of maritime trade vital for economic stakeholders and policy-makers alike. However, the vast expanse of global waterways poses a significant challenge for real-time monitoring and analysis. The advent of open-source satellite imagery providers like Copernicus by ESA, coupled with the proliferation of machine learning and Explainable AI tools, presents a unique opportunity to automate the tracking and analysis of maritime trade. This research endeavors to harness these technological advancements to provide a nuanced, real-time insight into the global maritime trade economy.
