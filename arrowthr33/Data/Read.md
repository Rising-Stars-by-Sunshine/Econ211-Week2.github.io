For this project, crucial data collection entails acquiring high-resolution satellite imagery from reputable sources such as Copernicus by ESA, focusing on regions of maritime commercial activity. This imagery will serve as a primary dataset for identifying and tracking maritime vessels using machine learning models. Additionally, AIS (Automatic Identification System) data, which provides precise vessel locations, identities, and additional attributes, will be collected to validate the findings from the satellite imagery analysis and to serve as ground truth data. This AIS data, when juxtaposed with the satellite imagery, can help in creating a more comprehensive understanding of maritime traffic patterns. Moreover, temporal data collection is vital to facilitate time-series analysis, enabling the monitoring of maritime traffic evolution over time, and the identification of anomalies or trends that might indicate broader economic or geopolitical developments affecting the maritime trade economy. Collectively, these datasets form the backbone of our analysis, allowing for a multifaceted exploration of global maritime trade dynamics.
