Explainable AI for Credit Assessment in Banks,"Banks’ credit scoring models are required by financial authorities to be explainable. This paper proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model for predicting credit default on a unique dataset of unsecured consumer loans provided by a Norwegian bank. We combined a LightGBM model with SHAP, which enables the interpretation of explanatory variables affecting the predictions. The LightGBM model clearly outperforms the bank’s actual credit scoring model (Logistic Regression). We found that the most important explanatory variables for predicting default in the LightGBM model are the volatility of utilized credit balance, remaining credit in percentage of total credit and the duration of the customer relationship. Our main contribution is the implementation of XAI methods in banking, exploring how these methods can be applied to improve the interpretability and reliability of state-of-the-art AI models. We also suggest a method for analyzing the potential economic value of an improved credit scoring model.",,,,,
Google Cloud Platform: Bigquery Explainable AI,"Machine-learning (ML) models have become a common tool used across a multitude of industries to help people make decisions. As these models have increased in predictive power, many have also grown in complexity. The pursuit to improve the accuracy of predictions has diminished the interpretability of many models—leaving users with little understanding of the model's behavior or trust in its predictions. The field of eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) seeks to encourage the development of interpretable models. Google Cloud Platform offers two Explainable AI functions in BigQuery ML that allow users to examine the attribution of model features, which aids in model behavior verification and bias recognition. One of the functions available in BigQuery provides a global perspective on the features used to train the model, while the second function examines local feature attribution associated with individual predictions in more detail. This note offers an overview of Explainable AI in BigQuery ML, using as an example a (fictional) realtor's linear regression model that predicted a home's latest sale price based on predictor variables such as the total tax assessment from the year of the last sale, the square footage of the house, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and whether the condition of the home is below average. After training the linear model, the feature attribution can be studied from a global and local perspective in BigQuery.",,,,,
"Explainable AI: A brief survey on history, research areas, approaches and challenges","Deep learning has made significant contribution to the recent progress in artificial intelligence. In comparison to traditional machine learning methods such as decision trees and support vector machines, deep learning methods have achieved substantial improvement in various prediction tasks. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are comparably weak in explaining their inference processes and final results, and they are typically treated as a black-box by both developers and users. Some people even consider DNNs (deep neural networks) in the current stage rather as alchemy, than as real science. In many real-world applications such as business decision, process optimization, medical diagnosis and investment recommendation, explainability and transparency of our AI systems become particularly essential for their users, for the people who are affected by AI decisions, and furthermore, for the researchers and developers who create the AI solutions. In recent years, the explainability and explainable AI have received increasing attention by both research community and industry. This paper first introduces the history of Explainable AI, starting from expert systems and traditional machine learning approaches to the latest progress in the context of modern deep learning, and then describes the major research areas and the state-of-art approaches in recent years. The paper ends with a discussion on the challenges and future directions.",,,,,
