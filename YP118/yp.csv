"A Survey on Medical Explainable AI (XAI): Recent Progress, Explainability Approach, Human Interaction and Scoring System.","The emerging field of eXplainable AI (XAI) in the medical domain is considered to be of utmost importance. Meanwhile, incorporating explanations in the medical domain with respect to legal and ethical AI is necessary to understand detailed decisions, results, and current status of the patient’s conditions. Successively, we will be presenting a detailed survey for the medical XAI with the model enhancements, evaluation methods, significant overview of case studies with open box architecture, medical open datasets, and future improvements. Potential differences in AI and XAI methods are provided with the recent XAI methods stated as (i) local and global methods for preprocessing, (ii) knowledge base and distillation algorithms, and (iii) interpretable machine learning. XAI characteristics details with future healthcare explainability is included prominently, whereas the pre-requisite provides insights for the brainstorming sessions before beginning a medical XAI project. Practical case study determines the recent XAI progress leading to the advance developments within the medical field. Ultimately, this survey proposes critical ideas surrounding a user-in-theloop approach, with an emphasis on human–machine collaboration, to better produce explainable solutions. The surrounding details of the XAI feedback system for human rating-based evaluation provides intelligible insights into a constructive method to produce human enforced explanation feedback. For a long time, XAI limitations of the ratings, scores and grading are present. Therefore, a novel XAI recommendation system and XAI scoring system are designed and approached from this work. Additionally, this paper encourages the importance of implementing explainable solutions into the high impact medical field."
The four dimensions of contestable AI diagnostics - A patient-centric approach to explainable AI,"The problem of the explainability of AI decision-making has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In considering AI diagnostics we suggest that explainability should be explicated as ‘effective contestability’. Taking a patient-centric approach we argue that patients should be able to contest the diagnoses of AI diagnostic systems, and that effective contestation of patient-relevant aspect of AI diagnoses requires the availability of different types of information about 1) the AI system’s use of data, 2) the system’s potential biases, 3) the system performance, and 4) the division of labour between the system and health care professionals. We justify and define thirteen specific informational requirements that follows from ‘contestability’. We further show not only that contestability is a weaker requirement than some of the proposed criteria of explainability, but also that it does not introduce poorly grounded double standards for AI and health care professionals’ diagnostics, and does not come at the cost of AI system performance. Finally, we briefly discuss whether the contestability requirements introduced here are domain-specific."
