Abstract

The burgeoning e-commerce market presents significant opportunities for cross-border B2B platforms, particularly between Chinese suppliers and Russian entrepreneurs utilizing online marketplaces like Ozon and Wildberries. This research intends to delineate the requisite investment for establishing such a platform, scrutinizing associated risks and regulatory challenges. It leverages insights from existing literature, such as the work of Michaelidou et al. (2011), to understand the dynamics of B2B social media marketing, which could play a crucial role in the platform's adoption and success. By mapping out the initial startup costs, operational expenses, revenue models, and potential financial risks, the study aims to provide a comprehensive investment blueprint. It also addresses the complexities of Sino-Russian trade regulations and data protection laws, thereby offering a nuanced perspective on the regulatory landscape. To enhance the user experience and facilitate cross-cultural communication, this research incorporates eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for user-friendly UI/UX design and real-time translations.
