# Data Query Process Readme

The `query_data.py` script is designed to facilitate the extraction of specific information from the `ClimateData_Sample.csv` dataset. This script employs Python's Pandas library to read the dataset and perform data querying tasks efficiently. Key features include filtering data based on temperature, humidity, and wind speed criteria. For example, users can extract all records where the temperature exceeds a certain value or days with high wind speeds. This process is crucial for researchers focusing on extreme weather conditions or analyzing climate trends. The script is user-friendly and can be easily modified to accommodate different data querying needs, making it a versatile tool for preliminary climate data analysis.
