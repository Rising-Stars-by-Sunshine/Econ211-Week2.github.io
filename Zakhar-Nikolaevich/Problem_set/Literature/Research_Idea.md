# Enhancing Climate Predictions with Explainable AI

## Background/Motivation

The escalating impacts of climate change necessitate accurate regional climate predictions. Traditional Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are computationally intensive, limiting their scalability (Jacob et al. 2014). Deep learning emulators offer a promising alternative, yet their 'black-box' nature raises concerns about their reliability and interpretability (Bano-Medina et al. 2021).

## Research Question

How can Explainable AI (XAI) techniques enhance the interpretability and reliability of deep learning emulators in regional climate modeling?

## Application Scenarios

The research will be applied to develop and evaluate deep learning-based climate models across various climatic zones, emphasizing regions with high climate variability.

## Methodology

- **Theoretical Analysis**: Review current deep learning methods used in climate modeling and identify potential XAI techniques for enhancement (Gunning and Aha 2019).
- **Empirical Observation**: Analyze existing climate predictions from deep learning models, assessing their performance and reliability.
- **Experimental Investigation**: Implement XAI techniques in deep learning emulators and compare their performance with traditional models.

## Results

Expected outcomes include improved transparency in AI-driven climate models, enhanced predictive accuracy, and a framework for integrating XAI in environmental science.

## Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts

The research aims to bridge the gap between AI and climate science, providing a robust tool for climate researchers and policymakers. Practical impacts include more reliable regional climate projections, aiding in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.
