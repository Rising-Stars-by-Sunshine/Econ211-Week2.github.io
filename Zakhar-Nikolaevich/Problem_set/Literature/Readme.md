Delving into Explainable AI (XAI), we start by defining it as an AI system or methodology that enables human intellectual oversight, making AI decisions and predictions more understandable and transparent (Wikipedia 2023). A key research question in XAI involves understanding and enhancing AI transparency from various perspectives, including regulatory, scientific, and social (ar5iv.org 2023).

To address this, the research will employ three scientific approaches:

Theoretical Analysis: Developing models and algorithms for improved AI explainability.
Empirical Observation: Studying the real-world applications and impacts of XAI.
Experimental Investigation: Testing new XAI tools and methods.
